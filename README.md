# Python-Exploit-version-checker
Automatically checks exploit versions and sends them to a discord webhook

Can be modified in multiple ways to your liking, all in one file for ease of use. Basic instructions on how to use can be found inside the Python script.

If you don't want to run this yourself, you can alternatively join the Discord server where updates will be posted in an Announcement channel where you can add them to your own server.
